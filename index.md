### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because we learned how to make a game of Mad Libs. This lab also helped me understand the basics of std:string, cin, and cout. It was a great beginner lab that helped demonstrate how to properly use cin, cout, and operators like << and >>.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because I personally enjoy guessing games. Getting to make a game like this one was great because we got to utilize operators such as >, <, and ==. In the program, we also got to write fun messages such as "Great!! I'd love to play again", and "you're getting warmer/colder!"

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was a favorite because I though it was interesting that we could make a program that could tell us the population of counties in California. This program also had use incorporate the command push_back. It was very interesting to see how these types of commands work in the code.
